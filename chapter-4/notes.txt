Build Strategies
The following are the available build strategies in OpenShift:
• Source
• Pipeline
• Docker
• Custom

Build Input Sources
A build input source provides source content for builds. OpenShift supports the following six types of input sources, listed in order of precedence:
• Dockerfile: Specifies the Dockerfile inline to build an image.
• Image: You can provide additional files to the build process when you build from images.
• Git: OpenShift clones the input application source code from a Git repository. It is possible to configure the default location inside the repository where the build looks for application source code.
• Binary: Allows streaming binary content from a local file system to the builder.
• Input secrets: You can use input secrets to allow creating credentials for the build that are not available in the final application image.
• External artifacts: Allow copying binary files to the build process.
